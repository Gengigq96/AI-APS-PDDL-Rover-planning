# AI-APS-PDDL-Rover-planning
This project focuses on automated planning for a rover to achieve specific objectives while considering multiple constraints. The planning problem is modeled using PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language), and a server processes the domain and problem files to generate a valid plan. The results are then displayed in the terminal.
